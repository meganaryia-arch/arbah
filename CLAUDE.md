# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a Python-based project called "zen-quotes-lab" with a backend directory structure. The project is currently in its initial state with minimal setup.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Located in the `backend/` directory (currently empty)
- **Project Type**: Python-based application focused on quotes functionality

## Development Setup

Since this is a minimal Python project setup:

1. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
2. Set up a Python virtual environment:
   - `python -m venv venv`
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On Unix: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (once created)

## Common Commands

This section will be populated as the project develops with commands for:
- Running the application
- Running tests
- Code formatting and linting
- Building and deployment

## Notes

- This project is in its initial setup phase
- No dependencies, build configurations, or application code exists yet
- Future instances should check for updated configuration files as the project develops
